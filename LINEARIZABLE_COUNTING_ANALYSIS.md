# Linearizable Counting Networks for Mutual Exclusion: Analysis & Design

## 1. Paper Summaries

### 1.1 Lynch, Shavit, Shvartsman (1996) — "Counting Networks Are Practically Linearizable"

**Core result**: Standard counting networks (bitonic, periodic) are only *quiescently
consistent*, not linearizable. However, under bounded-time execution assumptions
(each balancer access completes within time *s*), the tokens produced are
**approximately linearizable** — the ordering deviates from a linearizable
counter by at most O(depth × concurrency).

**Key insight for locks**: If balancer access time is bounded (reasonable on
non-preemptive or real-time systems), then the successor of a thread holding
token *k* is likely to hold a token within *k ± window*, where
*window = O(depth) = O(log²W)*. This bounds the search for the successor
from O(n) to O(log²W) under favorable conditions.

**Timing assumption**: Each thread's step (balancer access) takes at most *s*
time units. Network processing of a single token takes at most *d* steps (depth).
Under these bounds, the "linearizability window" — the maximum reordering
distance — is O(d · s).

### 1.2 Herlihy, Shavit, Waarts (1996) — "Linearizable Counting Networks"

**Core result**: Constructs counting networks that ARE linearizable (not just
quiescently consistent). The construction modifies standard networks to add
a comparison-based routing mechanism.

**Key construction**: Each "comparable balancer" compares timestamps of arrivals
and routes the earlier arrival to the lower output wire. This serializes
traversals at each balancer, creating a linearization point.

**Lower bound**: Any **nonblocking** linearizable counting network requires
contention Ω(n). This means lock-free linearizable counting must have at least
linear contention — the distributed advantage of counting networks is lost.

**Blocking construction**: O(log²n) depth is achievable with **blocking**
balancers (threads may wait at balancers). This preserves the contention
distribution but sacrifices lock-freedom.

**Implication for locks**: Since we're building locks (inherently blocking),
the Ω(n) lower bound for nonblocking doesn't apply. We CAN have linearizable
counting with O(log²n) depth using blocking balancers. However, the blocking
at each balancer adds latency to the lock path.

## 2. The Successor-Lookup Problem

### 2.1 Current State: O(n) Scan

The existing `BitonicCountingLock` and `PeriodicCountingLock` unlock via:

```
grant_next():
  for i in [0, n):                      // O(n) scan
    if thread[i].waiting:
      compute (wire_dist, round, tid) priority
      track minimum
  wake minimum-priority thread
```

This scans ALL n threads to find the one with the best (wire_distance, round,
tid) triple. The priority ordering ensures the step-property-predicted successor
is preferred, but every thread must still be checked.

### 2.2 Goal: O(1) or O(W) Successor Lookup

If the network produces tokens with predictable structure, the unlocker can
compute the successor's (wire, round) pair directly:

```
Given current thread at (wire=w, round=r):
  successor_wire  = (w + 1) % W
  successor_round = r + (w == W-1 ? 1 : 0)
```

This prediction is exact under the step property (quiescence) and approximately
correct under practical linearizability (bounded timing).

### 2.3 Why Linearizability Matters

**Quiescent consistency** (standard counting networks):
- The step property y_i = ⌈(m-i)/W⌉ holds only at quiescent states
- Between quiescent states, tokens may be assigned "out of order"
- Per-pair rounds from different final-layer balancers are INDEPENDENT
- Tokens from `traverse_full()` are unique but NOT contiguous during concurrent access
- The successor at the predicted (wire, round) might not exist yet → scan needed

**Linearizability** (Lynch et al. practical, or Herlihy et al. construction):
- Token ordering is consistent with real-time (or approximately so)
- The successor's token value is close to predicted → bounded window search
- Under practical linearizability: window = O(depth) = O(log²W)
- Under true linearizability: successor is exactly at predicted position

**The critical difference**: Linearizability bounds the REAL-TIME gap between
consecutive tokens. Thread k's successor (token k+1) entered the network at
approximately the same time, so it will register soon. With mere quiescent
consistency, token k+1 could be a thread that entered much later, leaving the
unlocker spinning unpredictably.

## 3. Assumptions (Made Explicit)

### A1: Step Property Holds Approximately Under Concurrency
The step property y_i = ⌈(m-i)/W⌉ holds at quiescence. Under concurrent access,
the distribution across wires is approximately even but may deviate by up to
O(depth) tokens. This affects accuracy of the successor prediction.

**Where this breaks**: Under extreme contention, many tokens are "in flight"
simultaneously. The step property violation can be as large as the number of
concurrent traversals (bounded by n).

### A2: Balancer Access Time is Bounded (Practical Linearizability)
Each balancer access (fetch_add, TAS, or software lock) completes within bounded
time *s*. The network depth *d* gives a total traversal time bound of *d·s*.

**Where this breaks**: OS preemption. A thread can be descheduled mid-traversal
for arbitrarily long. This violates the timing bound and invalidates the
practical linearizability window. On preemptive systems, the "window" is
effectively unbounded.

**Mitigation**: The waker protocol handles this — if the predicted successor
hasn't registered, the unlocker sets a waker flag and the successor self-starts
on registration. The lock is still correct; only the O(1) prediction fails.

### A3: Thread Registration After Traversal is Bounded-Time
After completing network traversal, a thread writes its metadata to the per-wire
slot before spinning. The window between traversal completion and registration
is the "registration gap."

**Where this breaks**: Preemption between traversal and registration. Same
mitigation as A2: waker flag handles this.

### A4: Per-Wire Round Capacity is Sufficient
The per-wire slot array has finite capacity (rounds_cap). If more than
rounds_cap tokens land on a single wire before earlier tokens are served,
slots wrap around and corrupt.

**Condition**: rounds_cap ≥ max_concurrent_waiters / width. With n threads and
W = O(√n) width, this is O(√n) slots per wire.

### A5: Per-Pair Rounds Are Independent Across Final-Layer Balancers
The `traverse()` last-balancer value encodes a per-PAIR round, not a global round.
Two final-layer balancers may have arbitrarily different round counts during
concurrent access. This means `(last_val >> 1) * width + wire` produces unique
but NON-CONTIGUOUS tokens.

**Impact**: Direct successor prediction `next_token = my_token + 1` may reference
a token that doesn't exist (gap in the token space). The per-wire sweep fallback
handles this at O(W) cost.

### A6: Truly Linearizable Network Construction Requires Blocking
Herlihy-Shavit-Waarts proved that any nonblocking linearizable counting network
has contention Ω(n). Their blocking construction achieves O(log²n) but adds
waiting at each balancer. This increases lock-path latency.

**Trade-off**: True linearizability gives guaranteed O(1) successor lookup but
at the cost of higher lock-path latency. Practical linearizability gives O(1)
best-case with O(W) fallback, without modifying the network.

## 4. Proposed Designs

### Design A: Wire-Indexed Counting Lock (Predictive, O(W) Unlock)

**Architecture**:
- Standard bitonic/periodic network (unchanged)
- Per-wire slot arrays indexed by per-pair round
- Each wire tracks its `serve_round` (next round to serve)
- Non-atomic `next_to_serve` counter protected by lock ownership

**Lock path** (same complexity as current):
1. `(wire, round) = network.traverse(input, tid, &lv); round = lv >> 1`
2. Register at `wire_slots[wire][round % cap]`
3. Waker protocol (same as existing)

**Unlock path** (O(1) best, O(W) worst):
1. Increment `next_to_serve` (non-atomic, protected by lock)
2. Predict: `pred_wire = next_to_serve % width`, `pred_round computed from wire_heads`
3. Check `wire_slots[pred_wire][pred_round % cap]`
4. If hit: wake thread, advance `wire_heads[pred_wire]` → **O(1)**
5. Else: sweep all W wires for minimum `(serve_round, wire)` → **O(W)**
6. If none found: set waker flag

**Space**: O(W × rounds_cap) = O(W × n/W) = O(n) per-wire slots + O(W) wire heads

**Key advantage**: No extra atomic instruction on lock path. Unlock reduces from
O(n) to O(W). Under practical linearizability, prediction hits often → O(1) average.

**Key limitation**: Non-contiguous per-pair rounds break the `next_to_serve` prediction
under high concurrency. Fallback to O(W) sweep. Still much better than O(n).

> **Status (current implementation):** Design A is **broken** under multi-thread
> contention. The designated-waker protocol deadlocks when multiple threads
> compete across iterations. 2T+ benchmarks show 0 throughput. The `lw_*` type
> aliases exist in code but should not be benchmarked.

### Design B: Sequenced Counting Lock (Guaranteed O(1) Unlock)

**Architecture**:
- Standard bitonic/periodic network (for contention distribution)
- ONE global `atomic<size_t> global_seq` (the linearization point)
- Slot array indexed by sequence number
- `now_serving` counter (non-atomic, protected by lock)

**Lock path** (one extra atomic):
1. `network.traverse(input, tid)` — distributes contention across W/2 balancers
2. `seq = global_seq.fetch_add(1)` — THE linearization point. Contiguous.
3. Register at `slots[seq % cap]`
4. If `now_serving == seq`: self-grant
5. Else: spin on local flag

**Unlock path** (guaranteed O(1)):
1. `now_serving++`
2. Check `slots[now_serving % cap]`
3. If occupied: wake → **O(1) always**
4. Else: brief spin, then waker flag (successor hasn't registered yet)

**Space**: O(cap) slots where cap ≥ n (total threads)

**Key advantage**: Guaranteed O(1) unlock. The global_seq provides a true
linearization point — tokens are contiguous and globally ordered.

**Key limitation**: One additional shared cache line (global_seq). Under very high
contention, this becomes a serialization bottleneck. However, the counting network
distributes arrival times, so threads hit global_seq at staggered intervals,
reducing contention on it compared to a pure ticket lock.

> **Status (current implementation):** Design B is **broken** under multi-thread
> contention — similar deadlock issues as Design A. The `seq_*` type aliases
> exist in code but should not be benchmarked.

**Comparison to `cn_array_lock`** (removed): Architecturally similar — both use
a global counter for contiguous tokens + slot array for O(1) unlock. The
difference: cn_array used a FLAT (non-recursive) bitonic network where the
last-layer balancer's counter was the global sequence. Design B uses a RECURSIVE
network (deeper, better contention distribution at scale) with a SEPARATE global
counter. The cn_array implementation has been removed from the codebase.

### Design C: True Linearizable Network (Herlihy-Shavit-Waarts Construction)

**Not implemented.** The Ω(n) lower bound for nonblocking linearizable counting
makes this design impractical compared to Design B (which achieves linearization
with one atomic). A blocking construction is possible but adds complexity and
latency at each balancer without clear benefit over Design B.

## 5. Performance Analysis

| Metric               | Current O(n)           | Design A (Wire-Indexed) | Design B (Sequenced)  |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Lock atomics          | O(log²W) (network)     | O(log²W) (network)      | O(log²W + 1)          |

### 5.1 When to Use Which

- **Design A**: When lock-path contention must be minimized (no extra atomic).
  Good for moderate contention where the step property holds well.

- **Design B**: When unlock latency must be guaranteed O(1). The extra
  fetch_add on the lock path is a small price for deterministic unlock.
  Preferred for high-throughput scenarios where O(n) scan is the bottleneck.

- **Current O(n)**: When n is small (≤16) or when W ≈ n (so O(W) ≈ O(n) anyway).
  The simpler code may be faster for small thread counts due to lower constant factors.

### 5.2 The Step Property Under Concurrency

The step property guarantees even distribution at quiescence. Under k concurrent
traversals, the wire distribution can differ by at most k from the step property
prediction. Since the network has depth d = O(log²W), and at most d threads can
be simultaneously inside the network, the maximum deviation is O(d) = O(log²W).

This means Design A's prediction fails at most O(log²W) times per "epoch" of W
tokens, giving amortized O(1 + log²W/W) per unlock — essentially O(1) for large W.

### 5.3 Preemption Sensitivity

Both designs handle preemption correctly via the waker protocol:
- If the predicted successor hasn't registered (preempted mid-traversal):
  - Design A: falls back to wire sweep, then waker flag
  - Design B: brief spin, then waker flag
- The preempted thread self-starts when it eventually registers and finds the
  waker flag set

Correctness is unaffected. Performance degrades gracefully: one preemption adds
O(W) cost to Design A or O(spin) cost to Design B, not O(n).

## 6. Composable Unlock Schedules

The user's hypothesis about "composable unlock schedules" from linearizability
windows has a precise technical interpretation:

**Schedule**: The sequence of (wire, round) pairs in which threads are granted
the lock. The step property defines a "natural" schedule: wire 0 round 0,
wire 1 round 0, ..., wire W-1 round 0, wire 0 round 1, ...

**Composability**: If two counting networks (e.g., bitonic and periodic) produce
tokens with the same step property, their unlock schedules are interchangeable.
The per-wire slot infrastructure works regardless of which network produced the
(wire, round) assignment. This enables:

1. **Network-agnostic unlock**: The unlock logic is independent of whether the
   network is bitonic, periodic, or any other step-property-satisfying network.

2. **Modular design**: Swap networks without changing the unlock mechanism.
   Different networks may perform better under different contention patterns,
   and the per-wire unlock handles all of them.

3. **Window-based scheduling**: Under practical linearizability, the unlock
   examines a window of O(depth) candidates. Different networks have different
   depths (bitonic: O(log²W), periodic: O(log²W)), giving different window
   sizes and thus different scheduling precision/cost trade-offs.

## 7. Summary of Critical Findings

1. **Standard counting networks are NOT linearizable** — even with linearizable
   (CAS/fetch_add) balancers. The network composition only guarantees quiescent
   consistency. Per-pair rounds from different final-layer balancers are
   independent, producing unique but non-contiguous tokens.

2. **Practical linearizability** (Lynch et al.) bounds the non-contiguity under
   timing assumptions. The window is O(depth × concurrency). This enables
   predicted successor lookup with bounded fallback.

3. **True linearizability** (Herlihy et al.) requires Ω(n) contention for
   nonblocking, or O(log²n) with blocking. A single global fetch_add achieves
   the same linearization more efficiently (Design B).

4. **Per-wire indexing** (Design A) reduces the unlock scan from O(n) threads to
   O(W) wires without any extra atomic. This is the most novel contribution.

5. **The step property IS the key** — it enables wire-based organization and
   successor prediction. Linearizability refines the prediction accuracy but
   the step property alone provides the O(n) → O(W) reduction.

6. **OS preemption** is the practical enemy of all these optimizations. The waker
   protocol is essential for correctness under arbitrary scheduling.
